#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- First, I'll investigat teh schema of the tables in the database.
-- Investigating the schema of the customers table
--SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers WHERE length(order_id) = 6 AND order_id <> 'Order ID' AND order_id IS NOT NULL AND order_id <> '' LIMIT 20;
-- We have cleaned out order ids that may be null or invalid. We also see the customers table has two columns, namely:
--customers.order_id
--customers.acctnum

-- Investigating the schema of the JanSales table
-- SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales LIMIT 20;
-- The JanSales table has 6 columns, namely:
-- JanSales.orderID
-- JanSales.Product
-- JanSales.Quantity
-- JanSales.price
-- JanSales.orderdate
-- JanSales.location
-- The orderID column is linked to the order_id column in the customers table

-- Part 1. How many of those orders were placed in January?
-- SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
-- FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
-- WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID <> '';

-- Part 2. How many of those orders were an iPhone?
-- SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
-- FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
-- WHERE Product = 'iPhone' AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND orderID IS NOT NULL AND orderID <> '';

-- Investigate the schema of the FebSakes table
-- SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales LIMIT 20;
-- Similar to the JanSales table, the orderID for FebSales is linked to the order_id for customers

-- Part 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
-- SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum
-- FROM customers
-- INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
-- ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
-- WHERE length(order_id) = 6 AND order_id <> 'Order ID' AND order_id IS NOT NULL AND order_id <> '';

-- Part 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
-- SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
-- FROM JanSales
-- GROUP BY Product,price
-- ORDER BY price ASC
-- LIMIT 1;

-- Part 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
-- SELECT Product,Price*SUM(quantity) AS Product_Revenue
-- FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
-- GROUP BY Product;

-- Part 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle WA 98101, how many of each were sold and what was the total revenue?

-- SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS TotalRevenue
-- FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
-- WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
-- GROUP BY Product;

-- Part 7. How many custoomers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
-- First let us select the results we want to see. We choose acctnum from the customers table to distinguish between customers. We also want the average price spent.  
-- SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*Price)
-- FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
-- LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
-- ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
-- WHERE Febsales.quantity > 2 
-- AND length(order_id) = 6 AND order_id <> 'Order ID' AND order_id IS NOT NULL AND order_id <> '';
